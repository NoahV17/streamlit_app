### Thesis
**"How do study habits, academic background, and demographic factors influence first-year GPA and academic success in college students?"**

This analysis aims to uncover which factors impact GPA, using three datasets. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between study hours, demographics, and academic performance to provide actionable insights for student support systems.

After exploring the datasets, we can draw several insights:
1. **Influence of Study Hours**: Study habits are crucial, but diminishing returns may occur at high study hours.
2. **Demographic Impact on GPA**: Factors like parental education, socioeconomic background, and gender may play a role in academic performance.
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: Insights like time management workshops, personalized tutoring, and early support for first-generation students could help improve GPA outcomes.

Future studies could incorporate larger datasets and track students over longer periods to confirm these findings.
